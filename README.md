# beta_bank
Supervised learning project
Beta Bank's customers are leaving, little by little, every month. Bankers have discovered that it's cheaper to save existing customers than to attract new ones.

We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have data on past customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank.

Create a model with the highest possible F1 value. To pass the review, you need an F1 value of at least 0.59. Check F1 for the test set.

In addition, you must measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it to the F1 value.
